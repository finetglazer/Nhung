# ESP32-S3 AI Smartwatch

A personal AI assistant smartwatch project built with the ESP32-S3 platform.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a wearable AI assistant with voice recognition capabilities, notification management, and basic smartwatch functionality. The device will connect to WiFi for cloud service communication while maintaining extended battery life.

### Key Features

- Time display and basic watch functionality
- Voice-activated AI assistant integration
- Notification management and reminders
- Low-power operation for extended battery life
- Simple and intuitive UI on a TFT display

## Hardware Requirements

- Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 TFT board
- Microphone module (e.g., I2S MEMS microphone)
- Battery (LiPo compatible with ESP32-S3 charging circuit)
- Buttons or touch interface for navigation
- Optional: RTC module for accurate timekeeping

## Software Requirements

- PlatformIO development environment
- Arduino framework for ESP32
- TFT_eSPI library for display management
- WiFi connectivity libraries
- Audio processing libraries (to be determined)
